## Overview

This was an experiment to add physics and rigid bodies to spheres. The user will be able to select a sphere which represents an atom of Carbon, Oxygen or Hydrogen and information abpout that molecule will appear.

## Issues

When in mobile view, there is no navigation. You can navigate the scene while in desktop mode using WASD.

The image of the atomic information does not appear in mobile view.

None of the select options I've tried have succefully trigger an event listner to show and hide the atoms onfo have been succesful.

## Future Feature

Add navigation to mobile experience.

Fix all issues.
